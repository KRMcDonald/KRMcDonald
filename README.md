Hi all, I'm Kyla McDonald and I'm a Data Analyst and Process Engineer. I've worked extensively with Power BI, Excel, SQL, and JMP. I'm currently focused on improving my SQL and learning Python. This GitHub profile contains my data/programming portfolio.

You can find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylamcdonald/). I've also got some larger video files of my graphical projects on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@krmcdonald14).

Some learning materials I've used on my journey and recommend: 
- [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) - I used this mainly for SQL, but they have lots of other material 
- [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) - SQL case studies
- [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - I love this, the projects are really fun and engaging, even at the absolute beginner level
