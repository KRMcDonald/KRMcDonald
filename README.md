Hi all, I'm Kyla McDonald and I'm a Data Analyst and Process Engineer. I've mainly worked with Power BI, SQL, and Excel (and some JMP). I'm learning more SQL, Python, and R. This GitHub page contains my data/programming portfolio.

You can find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylamcdonald/).

Some learning materials I recommend:
[DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) - I used this mainly for SQL, but they have lots of other material
[8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)
[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
